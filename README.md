# Code base for Korea · Culture · Critique

## About

We use SvelteKit. Mostly because it's very, very easy to write
in compared to most other frontend frameworks. I attribute that
mostly to two-way state bindings and scoped CSS.

## Dev setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/18kimn/korea-culture-critique.git
npm install --global pnpm #if you don't have pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then check out port 5173!
